# ElfParser
An ELF parser is a program or a library that can read and interpret files in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file format. The ELF format is used for executables, object files, and shared libraries on Unix-like systems, including Linux, Solaris, and the BSDs. An ELF parser is used to extract information from an ELF file, such as the list of symbols it defines, the sections it contains, and its dependencies on other libraries. It may also be used to modify the contents of an ELF file, for example, to add or remove symbols or to change the layout of the file.

The ELF format is used to represent a variety of different types of files, including executables, object files, and shared libraries. An ELF parser is used to extract information from these files and make it available to other programs. For example, a debugger might use an ELF parser to read the symbol table of an executable and find the addresses of functions and variables. A linker might use an ELF parser to read the list of dependencies of a shared library and link those dependencies into the final executable.

An ELF parser can also be used to modify the contents of an ELF file. For example, you might use an ELF parser to add or remove symbols from an object file, or to change the layout of the file to make it more efficient.

Overall, the point of an ELF parser is to allow programs to read and interpret ELF files and make use of the information they contain.
